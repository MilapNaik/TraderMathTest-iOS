# TraderMathTestiOS

If youre looking to be a professional trader, a few of the interviews you will encounter will include extremely tough mental arithmetic tests. These tests are challenging and are meant to filter out everyone except only the strongest candidates with the best numerical skills. Ive created this app to help potential interviewees increase their numerical competence daily. This includes practicing with easy, medium, and hard question sets and 5, 10, 20, or even 80 questions tests depending on how much time a day you would like to devote to practicing. You can even keep track of your high scores. Practice daily and these arithmetic tests will not be the weak point in your application.

This app is free and has no ads. I made this purely because I wanted a way to practice for interviews and no other app on the Google Play Store has questions that are tough enough or in the style I wanted. I hope you enjoy and please contact me if you have an questions/suggestions.
